# Your Name - DevOps Portfolio

## Introduction
Welcome to my DevOps Portfolio! I am passionate about leveraging DevOps practices and tools to streamline software development and delivery. This portfolio showcases some of my projects and contributions in the field of DevOps.

## About Me
Briefly introduce yourself, your background, and your interests in the DevOps domain. Mention any relevant certifications or areas of expertise.

## Projects
List some of the notable DevOps-related projects you have worked on. Provide descriptions and links to their GitHub repositories or live demos.

### Project 1: [Project Name](link-to-repo-or-demo)
- Description: A brief overview of the project, its objectives, and technologies used.
- Role: Mention your specific role or contributions in the project.
- Technologies: List the tools and technologies used in the project (e.g., Docker, Jenkins, Kubernetes).

### Project 2: Deployed Cassandra Reaper to Automate Repairs for Enhanced Database Management
- Utilized Terraform to automate and deploy the needed Cassandra Reaper infrastructure in Amazon Web Service. The setup includes an EC2 instance to host the Reaper service, security groups to allow/deny traffic, a Load Balancer to distribute incoming traffic, a Target Group to manage the instances behind the Load Balancer, and a Route 53 A record to provide a user-friendly DNS entry for the Reaper service. This architecture ensures high availability, scalability, and efficient handling of requests to automate repairs in the Cassandra database, freeing up time for the database engineer.
- Ansible was employed to automate the configuration process for both Cassandra Reaper and the Cassandra backend. This allowed for efficient and consistent setup across the entire infrastructure. By leveraging Ansible's capabilities, the deployment and management of Cassandra Reaper and its backend became more streamlined and less error-prone, enhancing the overall efficiency and reliability of the system.
- As the DevOps engineer, I successfully freed up workload on the database admin by deploying Cassandra Reaper. This automated tool took care of routine maintenance tasks, such as repairs and node management, reducing the need for manual intervention. I ensured a reliable and scalable infrastructure, which minimized operational issues that the database admin would otherwise have to handle. With Cassandra Reaper in place, the database admin gained more time to focus on strategic tasks, performance optimization, and other critical aspects of database management, resulting in improved overall efficiency and reduced administrative burden.
